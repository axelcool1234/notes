# Notes
This is where I host my static website for notetaking.

## Notetaking Philosophy
I strive to write my notes as if I'm writing a textbook for beginners. I want
newcomers to the topic I'm writing my notes for to have at least a moderate
understanding of the concepts explained within each article.

### Contact
Please message me on Discord (username is Axelsoft) if you find a mistake in
one of my articles. Thank you.
