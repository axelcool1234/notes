# Written Proofs\
The following are proofs I have written as practice. Feel free to use these as
practice or reference for your own benefit. Please note that the ordering of the
general practice section is arbitrary.

## Specific Proofs
- Proof for the Pythagorean Theorem

### Weak Induction
<!----
1. An undirected graph with $n$ vertices is a tree iff it has these three
   properties:\
   (i) connected
   (ii) $n - 1$ edges
   (iii) no cycles

    In fact, any two of these properties implies the third. Prove by induction
    over $n$ that (i) and (ii) imply (iii) for all graphs with $n \geq 1$.

### Strong Induction
1. Consider the sequence: $a_1 = 2$, $a_2 = 4$, $a_n = 5a_{n-1} - a{n-2}$ $\forall
  \geq 3$. Prove using strong induction that $a_n = 2^n$ for all $n \geq 1$.
